# Verified test and benchmark suite (/traverse, /resolve, /pattern on refseq33m-experimental)

Design: `~/.cache/metagraph-traverse-plans/2026-10-13/suite/DESIGN.md` (v2; §8 is the interface contract).

## Runner, sampler, orchestrator, comparator, report (lane S2)

### Files
- `suite_common.py`: shared stdlib helpers (direct answer normaliser, answer digest, server timing/work
  extraction, execution plan, statistics, jsonl I/O). Copied to mex with the runner.
- `run_direct.py`: runs a manifest against one direct arm (`direct-local` on mex, `direct-remote` from the
  laptop); writes `executions.jsonl`, `raw/`, `run.json`, `state.json`; resumable; stops cleanly on SIGINT.
- `sampler.py`: `docker stats --no-stream` of the staging container and of sra_all (CPU) plus the host load,
  every 2 s, into `samples.jsonl` (started by `run_direct.py --sample-docker`, or on its own).
- `checks_stub.py`: stand-in for lane S1's `checks.py` with the same API (HTTP status only); the runner uses
  `checks.py` whenever it exists, and `run.json` names the module that ran.
- `manifest/runner_smoke5.json`: the runner's own 5-scenario smoke manifest (status checks only).

### Run directory
`runs/<UTC>_<release-short>/` (git-ignored):

    run.json  executions.jsonl  samples.jsonl  jobs.jsonl      merged over the arms (merge_run.py)
    compare.json  report.md  report.pdf
    arms/direct-local/   run.json executions.jsonl samples.jsonl raw/ state.json manifest.json runner.log
    arms/direct-remote/  the same (its samples come from a sampler on mex during the remote phase)
    arms/mcp/            a copy of the MCP runner's run directory (--mcp-run)

Each arm writes only its own sub-directory, so it resumes on its own and a pull from mex never overwrites
another arm's lines. `run_direct.py --out X` on its own writes X/executions.jsonl in the §8.3 schema.

### Decisions where the design is silent
- Executions per scenario: its `repeat` (default 1); repeat 0 is `cold`, later repeats `warm`. A scenario with
  `repeat` 1 whose index in the whole manifest is a multiple of 10 gets one warm repeat (§5 "every tenth
  scenario"; `--warm-every 0` turns it off). The index is global, so a subset run repeats the same scenarios.
- `timing_class` long is not run on direct-remote (the front proxy cuts at ~120 s): no execution line, the
  scenario is listed under `skipped` in the arm's run.json. Client timeouts: fast 120 s, slow 600 s, long
  1800 s; direct-remote at most 125 s.
- Execution lines carry the §8.3 fields plus `area`, `route`, `timing_class`, `ended_utc`, `error`
  ({code, text} of a refused or failed request) and `client` (connect_ms, ttfb_ms, bytes_wire, bytes_body,
  content_encoding, timeout_s). `outcome` is `error` when no HTTP status arrived (http 0, error.code
  `transport` / `timeout`), when the body could not be decoded, or when `checks.evaluate` raised.
- The normalised direct answer is `{http, body, error, headers}`: `error` from the host's `{"code", "error"}`
  body; `headers` keeps content-type and content-encoding for the protocol checks.
- `answer_digest` is the sha256 of the canonical JSON (sorted keys, compact) of the normalised answer without
  `headers` and without every `timing` key; on GET */capabilities also without `measured_*` / `observed_*`
  keys (the delivery calibration and the longest uninterruptible chunk change with the server's life).
- `server` in an execution line: `elapsed_ms` = the top-level `timing.elapsed_ms`, else the sum over the
  entries (patterns / seeds); `work` sums the entries' counters (pattern `work`, traverse per-arm `counters`
  as `counters.*`, the seed's `annotation` block as `annotation.*`; nested objects as dotted keys), with
  `memory_bytes` and `max_*` as peaks.
- Optional scenario fields for protocol cases: `headers` (overrides the defaults; null removes one) and
  `body_raw` (a string sent verbatim instead of the JSON of `request`). Defaults: `Content-Type:
  application/json`, `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate`, `Connection: close`, one connection per request.
- run.json keeps the three capabilities documents of the run's start, release / server_instance / index_fp
  (the first non-null value in /capabilities, /traverse/capabilities, /pattern/capabilities), the host load
  at start and end, every session (a resume adds one) and `server_instance_changed` (from a closing GET
  /capabilities: did the server restart during the run). The run directory keeps a copy of the manifest.
- Resume: the same `--out` again skips the executions already in executions.jsonl (a line torn by a kill is
  ignored and its execution runs again); another manifest in the same directory is refused.
