/**
 *  A ChunkedWaitQueue is a data structure that allows safe zero-copy data transfer from
 * one thread to another. There are a few fundamental differences between a normal
 * WaitQueue and this implementation:
 *  1. Users have no direct control over how elements are popped from the queue.
 *  Elements are popped from the queue in chunks whenever the single iterator of the queue
 * is far enough from the oldest element.
 *  2. The queue exposes a single iterator instance.  The Iterator instance allows
 * iterating the elements of the queue forward. The iterator will remove elements from the
 * queue as they become old. Limited iteration backwards is permitted with a maximum of
 * #fence_size elements from the most recently read element.
 *  4. Since the queue exposes a single iterator, it expects a single reader thread.
 * Multiple writers may push information into the queue.
 *
 *  The ChunkedWaitQueue uses a pre-allocated circular array to store the elements in
 * order to avoid resize and heap allocations at runtime.
 *
 * Writers can push_front a value to the queue, the reader can access elements in order
 * via a single iterator exposed by the class. The reader/iterator will block if there
 * are no available elements, the writers will block if the queue is full i.e. if it
 * contains buffer_size number of elements.
 *
 *  When the queue is shutdown, the reader will unblock. At destruction time, the queue is
 * shut down (if not already shut down) and the destructor will wait until all elements
 * were read (i.e. the iterator reaches past the last available element).
